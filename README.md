## Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients
This notebook is to do EDA on data to predict default of credit card clients

## Project Description:
Read data into Jupyter notebook, use pandas to import data into a data frame
Preprocess data: Explore data, check for missing data and apply data scaling. Justify the type of scaling used.

## Classification task:
Decide about a good evaluation strategy beside accuracy and justify your choice.
Apply all the classification models you've learned so far. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid Search to find the best hyper-parameter. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the results.
Your submission should have at least the following classification models: KNN classification, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Kerenilzed Support Vector Machine (rbf, poly, and linear), Decision Tree Classifier.
Finally, find the best model for the classification dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict the target values for the test_set.
